# GWAR_Individual_Nivi
Repository Files Description
1.Data270_project_Individual_Updated.ipynb

This Jupyter notebook contains the implementation of an individual XGBoost model for the H-Predict project. It includes both the baseline model and the hyperparameter-tuned model, demonstrating the process of model training, validation, and testing on healthcare cost prediction data.
2.xgb_model_data.pkl

A pickle file containing the trained baseline XGBoost model along with predictions and performance metrics (MSE, RMSE, R²) for training, validation, and testing datasets. This file facilitates easy loading of the model for further analysis or validation without the need to retrain.
3.xgb_model_results_hyperparameter.pkl

A pickle file containing the hyperparameter-tuned XGBoost model from the H-Predict project. This includes the optimized model parameters along with predictions and performance metrics (MSE, RMSE, R²) across training, validation, and testing datasets. It's used to assess the improvement in prediction accuracy due to hyperparameter tuning.
4.GWAR_Reference_ccs_pcode.csv

A CSV file that contains procedural codes relevant to the GWAR dataset, used as a reference for mapping or analysis purposes in healthcare cost prediction.
5.GWAR_Reference_ccs_dcode.csv

A CSV file that includes diagnostic codes from the GWAR dataset. This reference file is crucial for feature engineering and understanding the context of healthcare treatments in cost predictions.
